      <strong> Q: My team currently pays for spray charts. Is Statman Sprays really free? </strong>
      <p>  Statman Sprays is 100% free to use and presents data that is as accurate as anything else out there.
        We don't want money to get in the way of teams achieving their full potential. If you'd like to make a small donation to
        keep the site up and running, you can do so <a class = anchor href = 'https://www.buymeacoffee.com/StatmanSprays' target = '_blank'>here</a>.
      </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Where do the data come from? </strong>
      <p> Statman Sprays pulls publicly available play-by-play data from the <a class = anchor href = https://stats.ncaa.org target = '_blank'>NCAA stats repository</a>
      before it is cleaned and parsed to generate spray charts.
      <br><br>Our proprietary algorithm is specifically tailored to handle NCAA play-by-play text strings
      and is able to correctly capture the batter, location, and outcome for >99% of all balls in play.
      <br><br> If a play-by-play string is missing information we need (i.e. location), that play will be omitted from the spray chart.
      This may result in slight inconsistencies between offensive stats and the listed hit totals.
      If you still think we got something wrong or we're missing data you're looking for, let us know.
      </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Can I save a copy of a spray chart? </strong>
      <p> Absolutely, click on the print icon next to a player's name to print that chart or to save it as a PDF.
        <!-- Click on the link next to the team name to do the same for the whole team. -->
      </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Can I look at a player's career spray chart? </strong>
      <p> You know it! After selecting a player from the roster, click on the 'Show Career Spray' button towards the top of the page
        to switch back and forth between career and season spray charts. <br><br>
        <b> Be careful, though! </b> Becuase there is no way to identify unique players across multiple years with 100% accuracy,
        we're forced to look at every BIP associated with that player's name.
        If there are two players at that school with the same name, these data will be incorrect.
      </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Where can I see the batter's handedness? </strong>
      <p> Starting in 2025, batter handedness is available in the roster table and on spray charts.  </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Can I split out a spray chart by pitcher handedness? </strong>
      <p> Unfortunately, pitcher handedness is not available at this time </p><br>
