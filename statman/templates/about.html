      <div class = head>  How does it work? </div> <hr>
      Statman Sprays pulls rosters and play-by-play data for any team in the country straight from the
        <a id = ncAnchor href = https://stats.ncaa.org target = '_blank'>NCAA stats website</a>.
        Those data are cleaned and parsed by our proprietary algorithm before being made available to Statman Sprays users. <br> <br>
        Statman Sprays was developed by a former D3 student manager and current professional software developer who has
        spent years refining this process to bring you the most accurate and complete data possible.<br> <br>
        You have total control:
        <li> Search for any NCAA team using the search bar in the top right of the SPRAYS tab. </li>
        <li> To keep from filling our database with unncessary information, we allow our users to pull only the rosters and games they need.</li>
        <li> The table at the top shows which information has already be pulled from the NCAA website. Hover over the &#8634; icons to see when it was last updated. </li>
        <li> Click on a &#8634; icon to pull that data into our database. This only needs to be done once.</li>
        <li> If someone else has already loaded the data you are looking for, click on a player's name to see his spray chart. </li>
        <li> Use the headers on the top table to navigate between years. </li>
        <li> Take a look at the Update DB tab for an overview of what has already been pulled into our database. </li>
