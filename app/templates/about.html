      Advance scouting can be a challenge for college baseball coaches.
      Statman Sprays looks to make it a litle bit easier.
      <br><br>
      Using publically available play-by-play data, Statman Sprays
      offers free, accurate spray charts for any NCAA baseball player dating back to 2018.
      <br><br>
      Use our spray charts to understand your opponents and efficiently position your defenders.

    <div class = section>
      <div class = head>  How does it work? </div> <hr>
      Statman Sprays pulls rosters and play-by-play data for any team in the country straight from the
        <a id = ncAnchor href = https://stats.ncaa.org target = '_blank'>NCAA stats repository</a>.
        That data is cleaned, parsed, and stored in our public database and is available to any Statman Sprays user. <br> <br>
        Statman Sprays was developed by a former D3 student manager and current professional software developer who has
        spent years refining this process to bring you the most accurate and complete data possible.<br> <br>
        We give you total control:
        <li> Visit the UPDATE DB tab to extract data from NCAA stats repository and load it into our database.</li>
        <li> If someone else has already loaded the data you are looking for, hover over the desired table cell to make sure it's up to date. Otherwise, you're all set. </li>
        <li> From there, hop on over to the SPRAYS tab to visualize any batter’s batted ball tendencies </li>

      <div class = head>  FAQ </div> <hr>
      <strong> Q: Can I look at a batter's entire career rather than just 1 year at a time? </strong>
      <p> Because there is no unique way to identify players across years, spray charts are currently only available for 1 season at a time. </p> <br>

      <strong> Q: Can I split the data out by pitcher side? </strong>
      <p> Unfortunately, neither batter side not pitcher side is listed on the NCAA website or consistently on team sites. </p><br>

      <strong> Q: How do you deal with balls in the gap? </strong>
      <p> Balls in the gap, ball in the 5-6 or 3-4 holes, and balls up the middle are randomly assigned
        to one of the two possible field sections according to that batter’s tendencies. For example, a batter with 30 BIP to CF and 10 to LF
        will have balls hit to LCF placed in CF 75% of the time and in LF 25% of the time. <br> <br>
        This calculation is performed when the spray chart is drawn and can lead to slight changes in individual charts each time it is drawn. </p>

      <strong> Q: What happens to balls fielded by the pitcher or catcher? </strong>
      <p> Balls fielded by the pitcher or catcher are included in the Inf BIP total, but now in any section of the spray chart.</p>

      <strong> Q: Do you adjust for balls put in play against a defensive shift? </strong>
      <p> No, we assume that all balls are put in play against a traditional defensive allignment.  </p>

      <strong> Q: Why don't the hit and out totals match up with the stats I see on other sites? </strong>
      <p> Hit and out totals on each spray chart are aggregated from play-by-play strings which occassionally lack BIP locations or outomes.
      <br> <br> We ignore those faulty data points resulting in numbers that don't always line up perfectly with other aggregations.   </p>
