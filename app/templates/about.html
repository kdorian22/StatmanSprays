    <div class = section>
      <div class = head>  How does it work? </div> <hr>
      Statman Sprays pulls rosters and play-by-play data for any team in the country straight from the
        <a id = ncAnchor href = https://stats.ncaa.org target = '_blank'>NCAA stats repository</a>.
        That data is cleaned and parsed by our proprietary algorithm before being made available to Statman Sprays users. <br> <br>
        Statman Sprays was developed by a former D3 student manager and current professional software developer who has
        spent years refining this process to bring you the most accurate and complete data possible.<br> <br>
        You have total control:
        <li> Visit the UPDATE DB tab to extract data from NCAA stats repository and store it in our database.</li>
        <li> If someone else has already loaded the data you are looking for, hover over the desired table cell to make sure it's up to date. Otherwise, you're all set. </li>
        <li> From there, hop on over to the SPRAYS tab to visualize any batterâ€™s batted ball tendencies </li>
